## Preamble {.t}

Thus far, we have looked at several verbs for data manipulation. In this part, we are going to shift gear.

&nbsp;

We will talk about data visualization. Specifically, we will look at ``ggplot2``, which is part of ``tidyverse``.

``` {r eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

&nbsp;

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What purpose does data visualization serve? How can data visualization be effective?



## Preamble {.t}

Visualization helps us explore data and learn of any systematic patterns between variables that might otherwise go unnoticed. 

&nbsp;

Sometimes, these patterns may help us generate new hypotheses or shed new light on existing relationships. 



## ``ggplot2``: Introduction {.t}

We will use examples and exercises from this book (3rd edition available online):

``` {r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.height = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure/ggplot.png")
```

## ``ggplot2``: Introduction {.t}

A challenging thing about ``ggplot2`` isn't its codes. Rather, it is the understanding that graphics can be stitched from independent components insofar as grammar is concerned.

&nbsp;


If this part sounds confusing to you, think about what painters need to do to make one painting...

<!-- (Type of paint, type of base (paper, canvass, walls, etc.), then layout & perspective such and such) -->

## ``ggplot2``: Introduction {.t}

Under the hoods, paintings have several underlying layers. This is true of your graphics, and ``ggplot2`` utilizes this notion of layers to create complex visualizations.

&nbsp;

Now that the notion of layers is revealed, you might wonder how we can create graphics with ``ggplot2``?



## Basic steps {.t}

**Step 1**: You begin by mapping data to aesthetic attributes. This involves stating (1) what data you want to visualize and (2) which variables in your data frame you want to describe.



## Basic steps {.t}

**Step 1**: You begin by mapping data to aesthetic attributes. This involves stating (1) \textcolor{gured}{what data you want to visualize} and (2) which variables in your data frame you want to describe.

``` {r}
ggplot(data = mpg, ...
       )
```

\textcolor{gured}{data = mpg} maps the data frame ``mpg`` to data.

&nbsp;

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: At this stage, what do we get if we run this code?



## Basic steps {.t}

**Step 1**: You begin by mapping data to aesthetic attributes. This involves stating (1) what data you want to visualize and (2) \textcolor{gured}{which variables in your data frame you want to describe}.

``` {r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)
       )
```

\textcolor{gured}{aes(x = displ, y = cty)} maps "engine size" to x position and "city driving" to y position.

**Step 1**: You begin by mapping data to aesthetic attributes. This involves stating (1) what data you want to visualize and (2) which variables in your data frame you want to describe.

``` {r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)
       )
```

or:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)
         )
```

**Step 1**: You begin by mapping data to aesthetic attributes. This involves stating (1) what data you want to visualize and (2) which variables in your data frame you want to describe.

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)
         )
```

or:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(displ, cty)
         )
```



## Basic steps {.t}

**Step 2**: After you have set up a "frame," you add geometric objects (points, bars, lines, etc.) onto it layer by layer. You'll need at least one layer to complete a plot.

**Step 2**: After you have set up a "frame," you add geometric objects (points, bars, lines, etc.) onto it layer by layer. You'll need at least one layer to complete a plot.

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point()
```

\textcolor{gured}{geom\_point()} adds "points" as geometric objects to the frame.



## Basic steps {.t}

**Step 3**: Now that you have your plot, you can change its scales, break it up into subsets, or alter its look and feel. For example,

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class) ) +
  labs(x = "Engine size", y = "Miles per gallon") +
  facet_wrap(~ manufacturer) +
  theme_bw()
```



## Basic steps {.t}

**Step 4**: Finally, you can save your graphic to your working directory with:

``` {r}
ggsave("scatterplot.png", dpi = 300)
```



## Basic steps {.t}

To plot with ``ggplot2``, you must have data, aesthetic mappings, and geoms.

``` {r}
ggplot(data    = ...,
       mapping = aes(x = ..., y = ...) ) +
  geom_point()
```



## Exercise {.t}

Now that you know a little bit about a ``ggplot2`` call, describe the data, aesthetics mappings, and layers used for each of the following plots:

``` {r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy) ) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price) ) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy) ) + 
  geom_line()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty) ) + geom_histogram()
```



## Let's pause here... {.t}

``ggplot2`` contains over 30+ geoms for different kinds of plots (see [this site](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)), not to mention a few hundred other functions!

&nbsp;

We will focus on a fraction of these geoms to make sure we can transfer our knowledge to other things we can't cover in this lecture!



## ``geom_point()`` {.t}

Previously, we saw this:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point()
```

With ``geom_point()``, **individual observations** are plotted:



## ``geom_point()`` {.t}

We can add additional information to aesthetic attributes inside ``aes()``:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = drv) ) +
  geom_point()
```

``geom_point()`` understands ``color`` (or ``colour``), ``size``, and ``shape`` aesthetics. So, let's try this one:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, size = drv) ) +
  geom_point()
```



## ``geom_point()`` {.t}

You can specify ``aes()`` at the top level of the plot (with ``ggplot()``) or for each specific geom:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = drv) ) +
  geom_point()
```

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv) )
```

You'll see why this matters in a few slides!



## ``geom_point()`` {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What's wrong with the following code?

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty), color = drv) +
  geom_point()
```

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = "drv") ) +
  geom_point()
```



## ``geom_point()`` {.t}

For scatterplots with overlapping points, you can add ``alpha`` to make points more or less transparent:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv), alpha = 0.4)
```

Notice where ``alpha = 0.4`` lands inside ``geom_point()``. Contrast the previous code with this one, where ``alpha`` is inside ``aes()``:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv, 
                 alpha = 0.4) )
```



## Another layer: ``geom_text()`` {.t}

Recall that in ``ggplot2``, different components can be combined layer by layer. This means we can stack one layer on top of another to create complex graphics!

&nbsp;

Let's say we want to focus only on cars made by Ford.



## Another layer: ``geom_text()`` {.t}

We can do that with ``filter()``:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford")
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Now that we have only rows of cars made by Ford, what should we do next?



## Another layer: ``geom_text()`` {.t}

We pipe this data set to ``ggplot()``:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)
         ) +
  geom_point()
```



## Another layer: ``geom_text()`` {.t}

And if we want to label each point with text, we use ``geom_text()``:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)
         ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = model) ) #label required
```

Check [this site](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_text.html) for more information about text placement (``nudge_x`` and ``nudge_y``).



## Another layer: ``geom_text()`` {.t}

Previously, we discussed where aesthetic attributes can be placed:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford") %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = drv) ) +
  geom_point()
```

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv) )
```

However, we couldn't see any difference with these two code chunks.



## Another layer: ``geom_text()`` {.t}

Now with another layer added, where attributes are does matter:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = drv) ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = model) )
```

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  filter(manufacturer == "ford") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv) ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = model) )
```

Aesthetic attributes inside ``ggplot()`` are passed down to all geoms.



## Another layer: ``geom_smooth()`` {.t}

In many cases, we may want to fit a line that shows a trend in the data. That can be achieved with ``geom_smooth()``

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv) ) +
  geom_smooth()
```



## Another layer: ``geom_smooth()`` {.t}

we can specify a function to use with ``method`` and ``formula``: 

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv) ) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ x,
              se = FALSE
              )
```

You can try:

``` {r}
geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ exp(x), 
            se = FALSE )
```



## Another layer: ``geom_smooth()`` {.t}

Again, where aesthetic attributes are matters:

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty) ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv) ) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```

``` {r}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = drv) ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```



## Wrap-up {.t}

With ``ggplot2``, we can explore data in myriad ways. So far, we have looked at:

``` {r}
ggplot(data    = ..., 
       mapping = aes(x = .... y = ...)
       ) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = ..., 
                           size  = ..., 
                           shape = ... )
             ) +
  geom_text(mapping  = aes(label  = ... ) 
            ) + #or
  geom_smooth(method   = ..., 
              formula  = ..., 
              se       = FALSE
              )
```
