## Quiz {.t}

Use the following vectors to answer the questions below:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
scores <- c(3, 12, 8, 2, 4, 11, 15, 19, 3, 7, 6, 9)

answer <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
```

[1] What kind of vector is ``scores``? How many elements does it have?

[2] Check whether values of ``scores`` are either below 5 or above 10.

[3] Check whether values of ``scores`` are 11, 12, and 15.

[4] What kind of vector is ``answer``? Find the average of ``answer``.

[5] \textcolor{gured}{Bonus}: Extract ``scores`` below 7?



## Answers {.t}

| Here are the answers to the first four questions:

|   [1] ``typeof(scores)`` and ``length(scores)``

|   [2] ``scores < 5 | scores > 10``

|   [3] ``scores == 11 | scores == 12 | scores == 15``

|   [4] ``typeof(answer)`` and ``mean(answer)``
 

 
## Answers {.t}

But our answer to [3] is cumbersome and prone to error. 

- If we want to check if ``x`` is one of the "things" in ``y``, we can use ``%in%``.
- So, a better answer is: ``scores %in% c(11, 12, 15)``



## Answers {.t}

So far, we have learned: ``== != < <= > >=`` and ``x %in% c()``

Answer to [5] needs a bit more explanation about indices.



## Index & Subsetting {.t}

Say, we write:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
scores <- c(3, 12, 8, 2, 4, 11, 15, 19, 3, 7, 6, 9)

scores < 7      #or check <- scores < 7
```

What do we get with this code?



## Index & Subsetting {.t}

We'd like to extract ``scores`` below 7 from the vector (i.e., 3, 2, 4, 3, 6). We do not want ``T`` or ``F`` as an answer.

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
scores <- c(3, 12, 8, 2, 4, 11, 15, 19, 3, 7, 6, 9)
```

So, we'll need to talk about subsetting. Let's begin with subsetting with positive integers.

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
scores[1:2]

scores[c(1, 3, 5)]

scores[[2]]
```



## Index & Subsetting {.t}

We can subset with a comparison function, which will keep values that are ``TRUE``:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
scores[scores < 7]
```

And if we need position numbers instead:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
which(scores < 7)      #then

scores[which(scores < 7)]
```



## Recap {.t}

What we have seen so far:

>- ``numbers <- c(1, 2, 5, 6)``; ``numbers <- 1:10``

>- ``typeof(numbers)``; ``length(numbers)``

>- ``numbers[1:2]``; ``numbers[[2]]``

>- ``numbers >= 5``; ``(numbers / 2) == 0 | numbers >= 3``

>- ``numbers %in% c(3, 5, 7)``

>- ``numbers * 3``



<!-- ``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- mean(scores) -->

<!-- mean(scores, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- R comes equipped with numerous functions, and ``mean()`` is just one of them. Notice the argument ``na.rm = TRUE``. What do you think this argument does? -->

<!-- `na.rm` is a logical argument (i.e., it accepts ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE``). This tells the function whether ``NA`` should be removed. -->

<!-- ``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- scores <- c(3, 12, 8, 2, 4, 11, 15, NA, 3, 7, 6, NA) -->

<!-- mean(scores) -->

<!-- mean(scores, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->





# Part I

## Part I: The Basics {.t}

R contains numerous packages to perform various functions, and one of the first things we need to know is how to install external packages from CRAN:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("<package_name>")
```

For instance, to do data science, we'll need a package called ``tidyverse``. We can install that on our laptop with: 

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```



## Part I: The Basics {.t}

Once we have a package installed, we will need to load it with ``library()``:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Try calling a package ``lme4`` with ``library(lme4)``. What happened?



## Part I: The Basics {.t}

Now that we have discussed ``library()``, it's time we talk about our workflow!

- Ideally, we want to call all the packages we need for our analysis once;
- We then want to run some analysis on our data and save all the results in one place;
- We also want to keep a record of what we have done in R, so we can recreate all these things later. 


That can be achieved with an \textcolor{gured}{R project}!



## Part I: The Basics {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{R project} can be created right from RStudio:

``` {r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure/Rproject.png")
```



## Part I: The Basics {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{R project} can be created right from RStudio:

``` {r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure/Rproject2.png")
```


## Part I: The Basics {.t}

You can choose to place this newly-created \textcolor{gured}{R project} in any folder you want. You can then check where your project lives with:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```

Alternatively, you can see your current directory under Console.

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Why does this matter? What's the point of creating a project?



## Part I: The Basics {.t}

Run the following code (adapted from R for Data Science, p. 116):

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  theme_bw()

ggsave("diamonds.png") 


write_csv(diamonds, "diamonds.csv")
```



## Part I: The Basics {.t}

How can we foster this habit? A short answer is: create an \textcolor{gured}{R script}! 

An R Script, not the console, should be where your codes live.

- Begin with general comment about your script;
- Then, load all the packages you need in the preamble;
- Use comments to provide context for your analysis;
- Indent your codes and use new lines to your advantage.





# Part II

## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

In most data analysis projects, we deal with data frames. Each data frame is **a named list of vectors**. 

In data frames, the length of each element must be the same.

``` {r dataframe, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dat <- data.frame(Class  = c("A", "A", "A", 
                             "B", "B", "B"),
                  Gender = c("M", "F", "M", 
                             "F", "F", "M"),
                  Test   = c(15, 20, 21, 
                             16, 17, 18)
                  )
```



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

We can inspect the structure of a data frame with:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
str(dat)
```

which lists on each line an object with a column name.

Another useful function, which provides a descriptive summary, is:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
summary(dat)
```

And, finally, we can peak inside data frames:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
head(dat, n = 3)
tail(dat, n = 3)
```



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

We will work with data frames that come with the ``tidyverse`` package. Let's load two of the data sets:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data(diamonds)
data(mpg)
```

To find out more about these data sets, you can run ``help()`` such as ``help(diamonds)``.



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Answer the following questions

[1] How many columns does ``diamonds`` have? How about ``mpg``?

[2] In ``diamonds``, what vector are ``cut`` and ``color``? 

[3] Figure out what ``mpg`` is about by running ``help(mpg)``.



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

If we create a data frame with ``data.frame()`` or read in external data with base R functions (e.g., ``read.__``), we get a data frame.

Data frames have some undesirable behaviors. As shown in ``diamonds``, some character vectors are converted to **factors**.



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

``` {r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(diamonds)
```

``` {r echo = TRUE}
str(diamonds, vec.len = 0.5)
```



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

In this class, we will work with tibbles, which can be created with a function called ``tibble()``:

``` {r tibble, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tibble(Class  = c("A", "A", "A", 
                         "B", "B", "B"),
              Gender = c("M", "F", "M", 
                         "F", "F", "M"),
              Test   = c(15, 20, 21, 
                         16, 17, 18)
              )
```



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

Right now, we will not dwell on why we should work with tibbles rather than data frames. We will instead focus on some helpful functions. Previously: 

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class <- c("A", "A", "A", "A", "A",
           "B", "B", "B", "B", "B",
           "C", "C", "C", "C", "C"
           )
```

This is tedious and error-prone. Instead:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class <- rep(c("A", "B", "C"), times = 4)

class <- rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 4)
```



## Part II: Data frames & Tibbles {.t}

You can ``rep()`` with various types of vectors.

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1:5
b <- letters[1:5]

rep(a, each = 3)
rep(b, each = 2, times = 3)
```

Alternatively, you can generate a sequence of numbers with:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)
seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 100)
```



## Wrap-up {.t}

| We have discussed the following functions for data frames:

|   ``data.frame(a = , b = , ...)``
|   ``str()``
|   ``summary()``
|   ``head()``
|   ``tail()``


| And helpful functions to generate sequences for vectors:

|   ``seq()``
|   ``rep()``


| Sandwiched in between are the basics:

|   ``install.packages()``
|   ``library()``



## Homework {.t}

- First, create your own R project; 
- Then, move some data file into that folder; and  
- Last, create an R script for future analyses.
