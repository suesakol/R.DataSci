## Quiz {.t}

| Import Item.csv file into R. Some things you need to consider:

| [1] The file doesn't contain column names;

| [2] The first column, which looks like IDs, should be treated as 
|     characters;

| [3] The rest should be doubles. 



## Answers {.t}

Here are two possible options to import Item.csv:

``` {r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

``` {r}
library(tidyverse)

item <- read_csv(file      = "./Data/Item.csv", 
                 col_names = FALSE,
                 col_types = cols(
                   .default = col_double(),
                   X1       = col_character()
                   )
                 )
```



## Answers {.t}

Here are two possible options to import Item.csv:

``` {r}
item <- read_delim(file      = "./Data/Item.csv", 
                   delim     = ",", 
                   col_names = FALSE,
                   col_types = cols(
                     .default = col_double(),
                     X1       = col_character()
                   )
                 )
```

**NOTE**: You can specify column names by providing a vector of column names to ``col_names``.



## Answers {.t}

Here is an example:

``` {r}
column <- c("id", 
            "i1_1", "i1_2", "i1_3", "i1_4",
            "i2_1", "i2_2", "i2_3", "i2_4",
            "i3_1", "i3_2", "i3_3", "i3_4",
            "i4_1", "i4_2", "i4_3", "i4_4",
            "i5_1", "i5_2", "i5_3", "i5_4")

item <- read_csv(file      = "./Data/Item.csv",
                 col_names = column, 
                 col_types = cols(
                     .default = col_double(),
                     id       = col_character()
                     ) 
                 )
```



## Recap {.t}

Principles of tidy data:

- Each variable must have its own column;
- Each observation must have its own row; and
- Each value must have its own cell.

## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Let's take a close look at the data frame `item`. Is it tidy? Why or why not?



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{ANSWER}: The answer is no. 

&nbsp;

Perhaps the biggest problem in `item` is the fact that one variable takes up more than one column.

&nbsp;

Luckily, we can "tidy" this data frame with two functions: ``pivot_longer()`` and ``pivot_wider()``

&nbsp;

**NOTE**: You may have seen `gather()` and `spread()`. These two are now superseded by `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, respectively.



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

For now, let's look at columns `i1_1` through to `i1_4`: 

``` {r}
item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4)
```

These four columns are in fact values of another variable (e.g., questions, items, tests, etc.)!



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

So we need to combine these four columns. This can be done easily with ``pivot_longer()``. This function has four main arguments:

``` {r}
pivot_longer(data = ,           cols = , 
             names_to = " ",    values_to = " "
             )
```



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

So we need to combine these four columns. This can be done easily with ``pivot_longer()``. This function has four main arguments:

``` {r}
pivot_longer(data = ,           cols = , 
             names_to = " ",    values_to = " "
             )
```

So, let's give `pivot_longer()` the information it needs:

``` {r}
item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = i1_1:i1_4, 
               names_to  = "items",    
               values_to = "points"
               )
```



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

We can select columns to pivot using `dplyr::select` style. So, this also works:

``` {r}
item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !id, 
               names_to  = "items",    
               values_to = "points"
               )
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What are some other ways to pick these columns?



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

Let's look back at how we name our columns:

``` {r}
item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4)
```

Each item starts with "i" (which stands for "item"), followed by question numbers and options. 

&nbsp;

Now that `i1_1`, `i1_2` are values of the variable `items`, we run into one problem: These two numbers code different information. 



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

We can "break" these values (e.g., `i1_1`, `i1_2`) into smaller parts with the help of the following arguments:

``` {r}
item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !id, 
               names_to     = c("items", "choices"), 
               names_sep    = "_", 
               names_prefix = "i",  
               values_to    = "points"
               )
```

**NOTE**: `names_prefix` is used to remove matching strings from \textcolor{gured}{the start} of a variable name.



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

A slightly more complex take on the previous slide, with `names_pattern`:

``` {r}
item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !id, 
               names_to      = c("items", "choices"), 
               names_pattern = "i(.)_(.)", 
               values_to     = "points"
               )
```



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

But if this is a bit too much for you, there's always a helper. `seperate()` does the trick:

``` {r}
item_sm <- item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !id, 
               names_to      = "items", 
               values_to     = "points"
               ) %>% 
  separate(col  = items, 
           into = c("questions", "options") )
```



## Part I: ``pivot_longer()`` {.t}

The opposite of `separate()` is of course `unite()`:

``` {r}
item_sm %>% 
  unite(col = "items", c(questions, options), 
        sep = "."
        )
```



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

While `pivot_longer()` lengthens data, `pivot_wider()` does the opposite. It "widens" data! Previously:

``` {r}
item_ln <- item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !id,
               names_to  = "items", 
               values_to = "points")
```

Now, how can we widen `item_ln` which is in a long format?



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

We can use `pivot_wider()` to do that job:

``` {r}
pivot_wider(data = ,  names_from  = ,
                      values_from = 
           )
```

So, we can revert `item_ln` back to its original form:

``` {r}
item_ln %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from  = items,
              values_from = points)
```

We use a <`tidy-select`> style to select columns (without a quotation mark).



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

Like `pivot_longer()`, the use case of `pivot_wider()` is much more than what you just saw!

&nbsp;

Previously:

``` {r}
item_ln <- item %>% 
  select(id:i1_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !id, 
               names_to     = c("items", "choices"), 
               names_sep    = "_", 
               names_prefix = "i",  
               values_to    = "points"
               )
```



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

We can combine the two columns `items` and `choices` in `names_from`. `names_glue` tells `pivot_wider()` how we want the two columns to be combined:

``` {r}
item_ln %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from  = c(items, choices), 
              values_from = points, 
              names_glue = "i{items}_{choices}"
              )
```



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

Let's look at a slightly more challenging case with an existing data frame that comes with the `tidyverse` package:

``` {r eval = TRUE}
head(us_rent_income, n = 6)
```



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

Suppose we want to widen `variable` with values from `estimate` and `moe`, we can do provide both columns to `values_from`:

``` {r}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from  = variable, 
              values_from = c(estimate, moe)
              )
```

Notice that `pivot_wider()` makes the column names by joining the two parts together for us.



## Part II: ``pivot_wider()`` {.t}

We can change how the column names are created with our friend `names_glue`:

``` {r}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from  = variable, 
              values_from = c(estimate, moe),
              names_glue  = "{variable}.{.value}"
              )
```

Use `.value` to reference each of the two columns we provide to `values_from`.



## What's the point in all of these? {.t}

Let's illustrate this with `geom_point()`:

``` {r}
head(us_rent_income, n = 6)

us_rent_income %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = moe)) +
  geom_point()
```

This plot visualizes income and rent on the same plot because, for example, the column `estimate` happens to contain both sets of information. Ask yourself: Is this what you want?



## What's the point in all of these? {.t}

If all we ever want is to plot the relationships between `estimate` and `moe` of `income`, we can certainly go this route:

``` {r}
us_rent_income %>% 
  filter(variable == "income") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = moe)) +
  geom_point()
```



## What's the point in all of these? {.t}

But what if we wanted to depict the relationships between the estimates of income and those of rent? This means we need one column for `income.estimates` and the for `rent.estimates`:

``` {r}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from  = variable, 
              values_from = c(estimate, moe),
              names_glue  = "{variable}.{.value}") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = income.estimate, y = rent.estimate)
         ) +
  geom_point()
```
