## Preamble {.t}

Data come in various formats. Some of the most common ones are:

- spreadsheet files (\textcolor{gured}{.xlsx} or \textcolor{gured}{.csv});
- plain text files (\textcolor{gured}{.txt}); or
- SPSS files (\textcolor{gured}{.sav}).

&nbsp;

Thus far, we have worked with data that are part of R packages. But in real-world contexts, we often work with "our" data that are in one of the above formats. How do we get those data into R?



## Preamble {.t}

In this part, we will learn how to read in rectangular files (i.e., ones that consist of rows and columns) into R with ``readr`` 

&nbsp;

``readr`` is part of ``tidyverse``. So, before we go any further, let's call the package.

``` {r eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```



## Part I: Pro Tip #2 {.t}

It is important that our data be tidy. This ensures that we can apply transformations to our data using tools in the ``tidyverse`` package.

&nbsp;

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What do tidy data have in common?



## Part I: Pro Tip #2 {.t}

Principles of tidy data:

- Each variable must have its own column;
- Each observation must have its own row; and
- Each value must have its own cell.



## Part I: Pro Tip #2 {.t}

Principles of tidy data:

- Each variable must have its own column;
- Each observation must have its own row; and
- Each value must have its own cell.

## Part I: Pro Tip #2 {.t}

Tidy data aren't just about R (though they help make vectorized operations in R shine). 

&nbsp;

So, make sure your data are tidy everywhere (e.g., in Excel spreadsheet etc.)



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

Now that we know how tidy data look, let's work our way through getting these data into R!

&nbsp;

We will use ``read_csv()`` to practice data import. Once you master it, you can apply the knowledge to other kinds of files.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``read_csv()`` works with comma separated files (i.e., the ones that end with \textcolor{gured}{.csv}).

- The \textcolor{gured}{first} thing we need is a file name:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "Income.csv")
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``read_csv()`` works with comma separated files (i.e., the ones that end with \textcolor{gured}{.csv}).

- The \textcolor{gured}{first} thing we need is a file name:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "Income.csv")
```

- But if that file is in a different folder:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv")
```

**NOTE**: Use ``getwd()`` to see your current directory.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``getwd()`` returns the absolute path to our current directory, which we can use in ``read_csv()``

&nbsp;

But this is generally not recommended. Assuming that you always have a folder called "Data" in any of your R projects, it's better to use a relative path when you read in a file:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv")
```

**NOTE**: Use forward slashes (/) for path, regardless of your computer's OS (Mac or Windows).



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``read_csv()`` works with comma separated files (i.e., the ones that end with \textcolor{gured}{.csv}).

- The \textcolor{gured}{second} thing we need is column names:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   col_names = TRUE )   #default
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``read_csv()`` works with comma separated files (i.e., the ones that end with \textcolor{gured}{.csv}).

- The \textcolor{gured}{second} thing we need is column names:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   col_names = TRUE )   #default
```

- If column name is missing, use ``FALSE``:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   col_names = FALSE )  
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: what does ``col_names = FALSE`` do?



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

Alternatively, ``col_names`` accepts a character vector, which will be used as column names: 

``` {r}
#DO NOT RUN
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   col_names = c("year", 
                                 "option", 
                                 "status") 
                   )  
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``read_csv()`` works with comma separated files (i.e., the ones that end with \textcolor{gured}{.csv}).

- The \textcolor{gured}{third} thing we need is NAs:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   na = c("", "NA") ) #default  
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``read_csv()`` works with comma separated files (i.e., the ones that end with \textcolor{gured}{.csv}).

- The \textcolor{gured}{third} thing we need is NAs:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   na   = c("", "NA") ) #default  
```

- If there's no missing values, you can omit this argument or:

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   na   = character() )  
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

But if your missing value is coded as something else (e.g., 999), pass that number to ``na`` as a character string:

``` {r}
#EXAMPLE
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   na   = c("618", "715", "775") )  
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

If you're curious about how ``read_csv()`` works behind the scenes, check out [this site](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html). This understanding will help us with the next few slides.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

Thus far, we have ignored the message in red that ``read_csv()`` prints out to the console. But now we are ready to talk about it.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

Thus far, we have ignored the message in red that ``read_csv()`` prints out to the console. But now we are ready to talk about it.

&nbsp;

``read_csv()`` (and other functions in ``readr``) automatically guesses the type of each column when it reads in files.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

``readr`` uses a number of heuristics to guess what each column is. But these heuristics can fail with a large file (1000 rows+). 

&nbsp;

For example,

``` {r}
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv") )
```

\textcolor{gured}{NOTE}: ``readr_example()`` finds the path to one of the files included with the package.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

If we look at the message, we see that the ``x`` column is parsed as a double vector, and the ``y`` column, a logical vector.

&nbsp;

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: View the data frame. What do you see? What is going on with ``y``?



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

If we look at the message, we see that the ``x`` column is parsed as a double vector, and the ``y`` column, a logical vector.

&nbsp;

Looking back at the console, we see warning which tells us what went wrong.



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

So, to fix this problem, you can provide specific column type to ``read_csv()`` with ``col_types``:

``` {r}
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv") 
                      col_types = cols(
                        x = col_double(),
                        y = col_date() 
                        #from y = col_logical()
                        )
                      )
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

We can provide different types of columns to ``col_types``. 

For instance, if we want to be explicit about column types in our ``income`` data set, we can treat country names as characters, while leaving all the other columns as doubles.

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   col_types = cols(
                     .default = col_double(),
                     country  = col_character()
                     )
                   )
```



## Part II: ``read_csv()`` {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What will happen if we run this code?

``` {r}
income <- read_csv(file = "./Data/Income.csv",
                   col_types = cols(
                     .default = col_double()
                     )
                   )
```

## Part IV: ``write_csv()`` {.t}

After we finish wrangling with data frames, we may want to write them back to disk. ``readr`` offers a useful function ``write_csv()`` for that purpose!



## Part IV: ``write_csv()`` {.t}

After we finish wrangling with data frames, we may want to write them back to disk. ``readr`` offers a useful function ``write_csv()`` for that purpose!

- The \textcolor{gured}{first} argument is a named data frame
- The \textcolor{gured}{second} argument is a file name

``` {r}
write_csv(income, "GDP.csv")
```

Check out [this page](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/write_delim.html) for more information.



## Part IV: ``write_csv()`` {.t}

To put a newly created file in a folder different from a current working space, use:

``` {r}
write_csv(income, "./Data/GDP.csv")
```

For other types of files, you can use ``write_delim()``:

``` {r}
write_delim(income, "GDP.csv", 
            delim = "\t")
```



## Wrap-up {.t}

In this part, we have discussed the following functions:

- ``read_csv()``;
- ``read_delim()``; and
- ``write_csv()``

&nbsp;

We have also learned how to:

- specify column types;
- provide column names; and
- read in files from the Internet
