## Quiz {.t}
Complete the following steps:

[1] Create a vector of heights (in cm) of 15 people:

[2] Subset the first four elements from the vector:

[3] Subset the final element from the vector (**Hint**: use [[ ]]):

[4] Subset even-numbered elements from the vector:

[5] Check whether values are below an average height:

[6] Find mean and standard deviation of heights:



## Answers {.t}

| These are just some of the ways:

|   [1] ``height <- c(150, 155, 160, ...)`` \footnote{A better answer is: height <- rnorm(n = 15, mean = 170, sd = 3)}

|   [2] ``height[1:4]``

|   [3] ``height[[15]]`` or 
|       ``height[[length(height)]]``

|   [4] ``height[c(FALSE, TRUE)]`` or 
|       ``height[seq(0, length(height), 2)]``

|   [5] ``height < mean(height)``

|   [6] ``mean(height)`` and ``sd(height)``



## Recap {.t}

So far, our focus has been on vectors:

- How to create them;
- How to subset them; and
- How to manipulate them.



## Recap {.t}

So far, our focus has been on vectors:

- How to create them;
- How to subset them; and
- How to manipulate them.


If this isn't yet obvious, an operation on vectors is also a vector:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
height <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 170, sd = 3)
height <- round(height, digits = 1)

test   <- height[height > mean(height)]

is.vector(test)
```



## Recap {.t}

We also discussed data frames (and tibbles). 

Each data frame is a **named list of vectors of equal length**.

``` {r tibble, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tibble(Class  = c("A", "A", "A", 
                         "B", "B", "B"),
              Gender = c("M", "F", "M", 
                         "F", "F", "M"),
              Test   = c(15, 20, 21, 
                         16, 17, 18)
              )
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Check whether ``Class`` and ``Gender`` are vector.



## Recap {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{ANSWER}: We use ``is.vector()`` from base R to test if x is a vector

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
dat$Class
dat$Gender

is.vector(dat$Class)
```

**NOTE**: We can refer to each column of a data frame with a dollar sign (``$``).



## Part I: Data frames {.t}

Once again, we create a data frame or tibble with ``data.frame()`` or ``tibble()``:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class <- tibble(ID     = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                Gender = c("M", "F", "T", "T", "M"),
                Rating = c(4, 5, 3, 2, 4),
                Math   = c(25, 33, 29, 21, 31)
                )
```



## Part I: Data frames {.t}

We can inspect data frames with some useful functions:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
str(dat)
summary(dat)

head(dat, n = 3)
tail(dat, n = 3)
```



## Part I: Data frames {.t}

But real data science questions require that you go beyond these simple functions! Let's load in some data set from ``tidyverese``:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(diamonds)
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What can you learn about the diamonds data set from these two functions?

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
str(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

**NOTE**: Read the package message. What warning message can you see?



## Part I: Data frames {.t}

In several cases, you may want to:

- Subset a large data frame based on some information in columns x or y;
- Select only a few columns from the whole data frame;
- Calculate summary statistics by groups;
- And many more

And ``str()`` and ``summary()`` won't be that useful in this regard.



## Part II: dplyr {.t}

This part corresponds to Chapter 3 in **R for Data Science**.

``` {r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure/Rbook.png")
```



## Part II: dplyr {.t}

Data transformation is an important first step toward a better understanding of your data!

For this part, we need ``dplyr`` which is part of the ``tidyverse`` package. 



## Part II: dplyr {.t}

``dplyr`` consists of many "verbs". Each verb performs a specific function:


| Verbs       | Functions                         |
|-------------| :---------------------------------|
|``filter``   | select rows by their values       |
|``select``   | select columns                    |
|``relocate`` | changes column positions          |
|``arrange``  | sorts rows by their values        |
|``mutate``   | creates new columns               |
|``summarize``| combines values to form a new one |

There are many other helpers & functions. We will slowly go through them!


## Part II: dplyr {.t}

These verbs are consistent; each function has the same "format":

| Arguments       | What is needed                       |
|-----------------|:-------------------------------------|
| 1$^{\text{st}}$ | Data frame                           |
| 2$^{\text{nd}}$+| Columns to be selected (w/o quote)   |


The end result is always a **tibble**.



## Part II: dplyr {.t}

We will begin slowly and go through each "verb" one by one. For each verb, we will also look at helper functions. 

- For now, things may look silly, but bear with me;
- Later, we will string all these verbs together with ``%>%`` (pipe);
- And we will get a long line of commands to perform some cool stuff



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

``select()`` is useful when you want to select columns. There are four ways to use ``select()``:

- pick columns by their *names*;
- pick columns by their *numbers*;
- pick columns by *functions*; and
- pick columns by *types*



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

``select()`` allows you to pick columns by their **names** (*while dropping others not chosen*):

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
diamonds

select(diamonds, x, y, z)

select(diamonds, c(x, y, z) )
```

If you want to create a new tibble from ``select()``, you can use a name to refer to it:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
diamonds_small <- select(diamonds, c(x, y, z) )
```



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

``select()`` works with a colon (:), and you can select between column a and column b:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(diamonds, x, y, z)

select(diamonds, x:z)
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What do these codes do?

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(diamonds, -x)
select(diamonds, -c(x, z))

select(diamonds, !x)
select(diamonds, !c(x, z))
```



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

``select()`` also works with **column numbers**:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(diamonds, 1, 3, 5)

select(diamonds, c(1, 3, 5) )

select(diamonds, 1:3)
```

This approach is generally not recommended. 

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Why do you think ``select()``ing by column numbers is not a good idea?



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

``select()`` also works with **functions** that select names:

| Functions              | What it does                                  |
|------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| ``starts_with("car")`` | select columns that starts with "car"         |
| ``ends_with("ty")``    | select columns that end with "ty"             |
| ``matches("\\d.+")``   | select columns with regular expressions       |
| ``contains("car")``    | select columns with "car" in the name         |
| ``everything()``       | select all columns                            |



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: Write codes to perform the following actions. 

You may combine helper functions with - and : to select columns:

[1] Select ``carat``, ``cut``, ``color``, and ``clarity`` from ``diamonds``;

[2] Select ``carat``, and ``cut``;

[3] Select ``depth``, ``table``, ``price``, ``x``, ``y``, and ``z``; and

[4] Select ``table`` and ``price``



## Part II: Pro Tip #1 {.t}

Column names:

- can contain letters, numbers, _ (underscore), and . (period);
- must begin with letters;
- should be consistent (e.g., starts/ends with the same naming);
- do not contain spaces



## Part II: Pro Tip #1 {.t}

Suppose you collect the following information: 

- *SES*, *GPA*, *test*, *family size*, and *gender* from students;  
- *size*, *status*, *achievement*, *standing*, and *SES* from schools

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: How would you name these variables in your data frame?



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

And lastly, ``select()`` can be used to pick columns by **types**:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(diamonds, where(is.numeric) )

select(diamonds, where(is.factor) )

# What happens here?
select(diamonds, where(is.character) )
```

**NOTE**: Notice ``where()`` along with ``is.*()`` functions



## Part II: ``select()`` {.t}

We can combine these four ways with Boolean operators (``&``, ``|`` or ``!``) to select columns. 

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(diamonds, starts_with("c") & where(is.factor) 
       )

select(diamonds, starts_with("c") & !where(is.factor) 
       )
```



## Part II: ``relocate()`` {.t}

``relocate()`` allows you to change the position of columns. The same four approaches to selecting columns apply:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
relocate(diamonds, clarity)

relocate(diamonds, clarity, depth)  

relocate(diamonds, 3:5)

relocate(diamonds, ends_with("e") )

relocate(diamonds, where(is.numeric) )

relocate(diamonds, starts_with("c") & where(is.factor) 
         )
```



## Part II: ``relocate()`` {.t}

You can tell ``relocate()`` where you want the columns to go with  ``.before =`` and ``.after =`` :

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
relocate(diamonds, x, .before = cut)
relocate(diamonds, x, .after = cut)    #but

relocate(diamonds, x, .before = cut, .after = carat) 
```



## Part II: ``select()`` then ``relocate()`` {.t}

Let's string the two verbs together. At the end of this whole lesson, we will see a smarter way to do this with less code:

``` {r select_relocate, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
small_dia <- select(diamonds, starts_with("c") & 
                      where(is.factor), x:z
                    )

small_dia <- relocate(small_dia, x:z, .before = color)

```



## Part II: Homework {.t}

Let's read it real data from a survey. For now, just copy and paste the code below:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(haven)

# read spss file (.sav) into R

wtp59 <- read_sav("ATPW59.sav") %>% 
  zap_label() %>% 
  zap_labels()
```

Play around with this data set. Read an accompanying pdf.
