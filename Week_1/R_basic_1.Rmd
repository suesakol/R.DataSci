```



## Quiz {.t}

Use the following vectors to answer the questions below:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
scores <- c(3, 12, 8, 2, 4, 11, 15, 19, 3, 7, 6, 9)

answer <- c("Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "Yes", 
            "No", "No", "No")
```

[1] Check if the values of ``scores`` exceed 10:

[2] Calculate the mean of ``scores``:

[3] Convert the values in ``answer`` to numbers (Y = 1; N = 0):



## Quiz {.t}

``` {r echo = FALSE}
dat <- data.frame(Score  = round(rnorm(n = 30, mean = 30, sd = 5), digits = 0), 
                  Gender = sample(c("male", "female"), size = 30, replace = TRUE),
                  Class  = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), size = 30, replace = TRUE))
```

Use the following dataframe to answer the following questions:

``` {r}
head(dat, n = 8)
```

[4] Find scores from female students

[5] Find students from class C only



## Introduction {.t}

We will use quite a lot of materials from this book:

``` {r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure/Rbook.png")
```

  + R is a **programming language** and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))


* Why should I learn R?
  + With R, we can turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge [(R for Data Science)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
  
  + R is an open-source software, which means it is absolutely free
  
  + R works across different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)



## Installing R {.t}

* Visit [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)]((https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)) to download R 

* We must have R installed for R Studio to work



## What is RStudio? {.t}

- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R

- RStudio is user-friendly, making it easier for us to interact with R with things like drop-down menus, etc.

- RStudio can be downloaded from [this site](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)



## RStudio {.t}

When we start RStudio, this is what we see:

``` {r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure/RStudio.png")
```





# Part I

## Part I: Basic Math {.t}

Four basic arithmetic operators:

* addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), and multiplication (*)

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
5 + 4 - 2
5 - 4 + 2

5 + 4 * 2
5 / 4 + 2
```



## Part I: Basic Math {.t}

The order of operations is ***PEMDAS***: Use parenthesis & space to make clear the order

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
(5 + 4) * 2
(5 + 4) * (2 + 5)

(5 + (4 / 2)) + (2 * 3)
```



## Part I: Basic Math {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What are these two symbols for: ^ and %%? 

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
2 ^ 3
3 ^ 4

5 %% 2
8 %% 3
```



## Part I: Basic Math {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{ANSWER}: ^ (raise x to the power of y) and %% (returns remainder of division)

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
2 ^ 3    # 2 * 2 * 2
3 ^ 4    # 3 * 3 * 3 * 3

5 %% 2   # 5 / 2 -->  4 + 1 / 2 
8 %% 3
```



## Part I: More math {.t}

There are a few other functions, which we will return to later on:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum()
mean()
sd()

min()
max()

log()
sqrt()
exp() 
```





# Part II

## Part II: Vector & Assignment {.t}

Vectors are the most basic data objects in R:

``` {r echo = TRUE}
numbers <- c(1, 3, 5, 8, 4, 9, 2)
names   <- c("Jack", "James", "Jill", "Alix")
answers <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) 
```

NOTE: 

* ``<-`` is an assignment symbol; shortcut =  **Option + minus**
* ``c()`` is short for combine

When we create a vector, we tell R that the name ``numbers`` refers to an object, which is ``c(1, 3, 5, 8, 4, 9, 2)``


## Part II: Vector & Assignment {.t}

We can use a colon operator (:) to create sequences

``` {r echo = TRUE}
num1  <- 1:10
num2  <- c(1:5, c(12, 16, 19), 30:40)
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

For now, we will focus on numeric vectors (numbers are doubles by default\footnote{Doubles are floating-point numbers and thus are approximations}).

``` {r echo = TRUE}
num1  <- c(1, 4, 12, 8, 6, 5) 
num2  <- c(2, 5, 9, 11, 2, 3)
```

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What will happen when ``num1 + num2``?



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{ANSWER}: Arithmetic operations in R are vectorized (i.e., operating on a vector of elements):

``` {r echo = TRUE}
num1

num2

num1 + num2
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What will happen if we sum these two vectors together?

``` {r echo = TRUE}
num1  <- c(11, 17, 23, 25, 26, 19)
num2  <- c(6, 13)
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{ANSWER}: R uses a recycling rule: a shorter vector is expanded to be of the same length as a longer one

``` {r echo = TRUE}
num1

num2

num1 + num2
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What will happen in this case?

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
num1  <- c(11, 17, 23, 25, 26, 19, 21)
num2  <- c(6, 13)

num1 + num2
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

Two key properties of vectors: *type* and *length*

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nums  <- c(3, 5, 11, 13)

typeof(nums)
length(nums)
```

We will get to use one of the built-in functions, ``length()``, in many different scenarios.



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: How many kinds of values can numeric vectors take?

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nums  <- c(-2, 0, 2, 4, NA)

nums/2

nums/0
```




## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

Why are we wasting our time on numeric vectors? Well, because they are useful if we want to talk about **comparison operators** in R:

* == (equal), != (not equal), >, >=, <, <=

We can check if elements inside a vector meet certain conditions

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nums  <- c(2, 4, 7, 9, 11, NA)

nums  == 11
nums  != 11
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What do you think are the answers to the following codes:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nums  <  9
nums  <= 9
```

We can apply these operators to solve some interesting problems:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
(nums %% 2) == 0
(nums %% 2) != 0
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

This whole comparison operations will be of limited use if we have to conduct each "test" one by one. But luckily:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nums >  5  &  nums <  10
nums <= 7  |  nums >  10
nums <= 7  |  nums != 11
nums <= 10 & !(nums %% 2 == 0)
```



## Part II: Numeric Vectors {.t}

\textcolor{gured}{EXERCISE}: What do we get from performing these operations? What does R return?

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
nums <- c(11, 6, 18, 21, 24, 18, 5, 9, 14)
nums >= 10
```

Well, you may find this a bit more familiar:

``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
test <- nums >= 10
typeof(test)
```
